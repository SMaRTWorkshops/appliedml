# Overview

class: onecol
## Plan for Today

First will be a lecture focusing on .imp[training models and making predictions] in R.

All modeling will be done with **{parsnip}**, part of the {tidymodels} meta-package.

Specifically, we will learn to `fit()` and `predict()` models with a common interface.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> We will end with a **live coding activity**. 

This will put everything we have learned today into practice. 

We will build a basic model and use it to predict out-of-sample testing data.

This will ease the transition to full ML {workflows}, which we will learn tomorrow.

---
class: onecol
## Motivation

Suppose we have collected data that are now ready to be fit to a statistical model. 

Let's say that a linear regression model is our first choice: 

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x1_i+...+\beta_px_{pi}$$
--

There are **many statistical methods available** for estimating these model parameters:
- Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression 

- Regularized linear regression<sup>1</sup>, such as lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression.

.footnote[
[1] No need to be familiar with regularization yet; we will learn about these algorithms in detail on Day 3! 
]

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">However, they use different R packages with **varying syntax, arguments, and output**. 

---
class: onecol
## A Problem

The {stats} package implements **OLS regression** using .imp[formula notation], with data accepted in a dataframe or vector.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model <- lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = df, ...)
```

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> The {glmnet} package implements **regularized regression** using .imp[x/y notation], with predictors required to be formatted as a numeric matrix and the outcome as a vector.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model <- glmnet(x = outcome, y = predictor, ...)
```

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> This makes it a **pain** to switch between models! 

---
class: onecol
## A Problem

Different packages also require different syntax to obtain **model predictions**.

Some examples of these inconsistencies for various classification models:

--

```{r timeline, echo=FALSE} 
timeline <- tribble( 
  ~FUNCTION, ~PACKAGE, ~CODE, 
  "glm", "stats", "predict(obj, type = 'response')", 
  "lda", "MASS", "predict(obj)", 
  "gbm", "gbm", "predict(obj, type = 'response', n.trees)", 
  "mda", "mda", "predict(obj, type = 'posterior')", 
  "rpart", "rpart", "predict(obj, type = 'prob')", 
  "Weka", "RWeka", "predict(obj, type = 'probability')", 
  "logitboost", "LogitBoost", "predict(obj, type = 'raw', nIter)", 
  "pamr.train", "pamr", "pamr.predict(obj, type = 'posterior')" 
) 
kable(timeline, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:80%;'") %>% kable_styling(font_size = 20, html_font = "courier new") 
```

class: twocol
## A Solution

.left-column[
<br />
```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("../figs/parsnip.png")
```
]

--

.right-column[
The {parsnip} package provides a **unified interface** for model fitting.

There are functions to:
- Specify models
- Fit models 
- Inspect model results
- Make predictions

We can fit any model with the **same syntax and data format**.

We **don't need to memorize** package-specific details!

# Introduction to {parsnip}

## A {parsnip} roadmap
</br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("../figs/parsnip_workflow.png")
```

---
class: onecol
## 1. Specify Model Details

Before fitting an ML model, we need to **specify the model details**.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">All models are specified with the same **syntactical structure** in {parsnip}.

- **Model Type**: the mathematical structure (e.g., linear regression, random forests)

- **Model Mode**: the mode of prediction (e.g., regression, classification)<sup>1</sup>.

- **Computational Engine**: how the actual model is fit (often a specific R package)

.footnote[
[1] Sometimes the model mode is already determined by the model type (e.g., linear regression) and so specifying a mode is not needed.
]

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">These details are specified *before* even referencing the data. 


---
class: onecol
## Example: Linear Regression

.pull-left[
To specify an OLS regression in {parsnip}, we designate:

- The model type as `linear_reg()` 

- The model mode as `"regression"`<sup>1</sup>.

- The computational engine as `"lm"`.
]

.footnote[
[1] Technically this is redundant because `linear_reg()` already implies `mode = regression`. Therefore, this `set_mode()` line could be dropped. 
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
library(tidymodels)
tidymodels_prefer()

# specify model details
reg_freq <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

```
]

---
class: twocol 
## The power of {parsnip}

{parsnip} makes it easy to build many different models .imp[without memorizing the idiosyncracies of various R packages].

To illustrate, let's specify frequentist and bayesian forms of linear and logistic regression:

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
reg_freq <-
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  set_engine("lm")

reg_bayes <-
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  set_engine("stan")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
log_freq <-
  logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("glm")

log_bayes <-
  logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("stan")
```
]

---
class: onecol
## More Computational Engines 

To see all the computational engines that exist for a model type, use `show_engines()`. 

--

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
show_engines("linear_reg")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
show_engines("linear_reg") %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(position = "left") %>% scroll_box(height = "300px")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
show_engines("logistic_reg")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
show_engines("logistic_reg") %>% kable() %>% scroll_box(height = "300px")
```
]

---
class: onecol 
## A World of Possibilities

There are **hundreds** of machine learning models available in {parsnip}.

Many models can be implemented in different ways (different computational engines).

You can explore all the options on the [tidymodels website](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/parsnip/).

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;">To fit different ML models, you just change the **model type** and `set_engine()`.

This makes it *super* easy to implement new algorithms and explore the world of ML!

## Comprehension Check \#1

### Question 1
**Which is *not* a part of specifying model details with {parsnip}?**

a) Model Mode

b) Model Form 

c) Computational Engine

d) Model Type


---
class: onecol
## Comprehension Check \#1

### Question 2
**What error was made in this code?**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_model <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("regression") %>% 
  set_mode("lm")
```

a) The name of the dataset is missing.

b) We forgot to specify frequentist vs bayesian regression.

c) The `set_engine()` function does not exist.

d) The arguments for `set_engine()` and `set_mode()` are reversed.


---
class: onecol
## 2. Fit Model

Once we have specified model details, we can fit the model using the `fit()` function.

--

`fit()` allows us to always use formula notation: 

 - `fit(y ~ x, data = training_data)`
 
 - `fit(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = training_data)`
 
 - `fit(y ~ ., data = training_data)`
 
--

This is possible regardless of whether the underlying package function uses formula or `x/y` interface, making it much easier to switch between models.


---
class: onecol
## 2. Fit Model

Let's walk through fitting a linear regression example with some pseudocode! 

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reg_freq <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  set_mode("regression")
```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ols_reg_fit <- reg_freq %>% 
  fit(outcome ~ predictor, data = training_data)
```

---
class: twocol
## 2. Fit Model

We don't have to use formula notation. `x/y` notation is also available with `fit_xy()`: 

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ols_reg_fit <- ols_reg %>% 
  fit_xy(x = predictor, y = outcome)
```

--

What is the difference between `fit()` and `fit_xy()`? 

- `fit_xy()` will pass your data **as is** to the underlying model function. 

- It will not create dummy variables for categorical predictors before doing so. 

- On the other hand, `fit()` will create dummy variables used with a model specification. 

--

.bg-light-yellow.b--light-red.ba.bw1.br3.pl4[
We recommend preprocessing (e.g., creating dummy variables) before model fitting. 

We'll learn how to do this with {recipes} tomorrow!
]


---
class: onecol 
## 3. Inspect Model Results

Once we fit a model, we can examine the model by printing or plotting it.

Some useful functions:

`tidy()`: return model summary (coefficient values, std error, *p* value) in a tibble.

- This is helpful for simple models that are easily interpretable (e.g., LM/GLM)

`vip()`: plot variable importance. 

- This is helpful for both simple models and complex models (e.g., random forests) that do not have interpretable coefficients.

---
class: onecol
## 4. Make Model Predictions 

Getting predictions for `parsnip` models is easy and *tidy* with `predict()`:

Argument&emsp; | Description
:------- | :----------
object | A trained model object created by `fit()`
new_data | A data frame with the same features as training
type | Data type (numeric, classes, probabilities, etc.)

---
class: onecol
## 4. Make Model Predictions

The `predict()` function will always return: 

- Predictions as a tibble

- The same number of rows as the data being predicted 

- Interpretable column names (e.g., `.pred`, `.pred_lower`, `.pred_upper`) 

- Consistent column names across all model types and engines 

--

.bg-light-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw1.br3.pl4[
These rules make it easier to merge predictions with the original data!
]

class: onecol
## Summary

Today started with a **conceptual overview** of the goals and methods of ML.

We reviewed **tidyverse** principles and datasets used in the course. 

We introduced the basic goals of **data splitting** with {rsample}.

We learned how to fit models and make predictions with {parsnip}.

--

<p style="padding-top:30px;"> We will wrap up with a **live coding activity** to tie everything together. 

Tomorrow will dive into **feature engineering** and **performance evaluation**.

We will also learn more advanced **cross-validation** for a full ML **workflow**.
